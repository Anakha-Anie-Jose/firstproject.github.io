<h1  id="Blog1">1.AN EVOLUTION TO FIGHT BACK</h1>
<p>The near future predicts the use of bottled oxygen similar 
to the kind of mineral water that we often use when we go on trips
 or may be in our daily lives as well. No wonder the concept of mineral 
 water was unknown 40 or 50 years ago when pure water from wells were 
 abundant enough to drink and even to waste. But the turn of 21st century
  witnessed drastic change of weather conditions-change in timings of seasons, 
  global warming, water scarcity and what more! And with our present condition, 
  100 years is more than enough for us to use bottled oxygen during our trips or 
  maybe in our daily lives too! Did u expect to use masks in your daily life before 
  the turn of 2020 ? Bottled oxygen will be coming in this unexpected way in 2100s.
Studying from the beginning of life, earth has changed a lot.</p>  
<p>We can’t expect to see Dinosuars and dragons in 2020 that were told to exist in 
the beginning of life. Obiviously man has changed a lot and Earth too. 
We have advanced from the level of a primitive man who struggled to escape
 from natural disasters to the advanced one who can tame those destructions 
 with his power.  However we gave up our unpolluted, pure earth to buy a 
 ‘EARTH FOR OUR NEEDS’. And Earth is struggling to cope with these changes 
 and to help her children thrive in Earth; Here we witness the abnormal 
 changes ununderstood by our technologies and unpredicted by our brains. </p>
<h3>Past is past,future is future,Live in the present</h3>
<p>We have been sticking to this motto that helped us improve in scientific
 and technological areas. We extract fuels from mines digging deep even 
 until the very root ignoring the day when even others has to answer for 
 our thoughtless behaviour. Cut all the trees and set up a mansion to live
  unseeing your real home perishing. Let all the unburned fuel in your 
  vehicles come out so that it mix up with oxygen, with your blood and 
  thus let us become human fuels. Let these fuels trap all the heat from
   sun increasing atmospheric temperature, melting icebergs causing floods 
   and killing polar animals.</p>
<h3>Use and throw</h3>
<p>Use plastic bags and bottles and throw them away when you don’t need 
them anymore; Helps us in killing earthworms and other Microbes in
 soil so no need to externally buy chemicals to kill them. And let us wait
  for these plastic bags and bottles and chemicals to do nitrogen fixation 
  and other processes and grow our plants.</p>
<h3>Evolution is applicable to earth too!</h3>
<p>Recent studies and researches began noticing the drastic changes in w
eather conditions ;long summers ,delayed monsoons ,droughts ,floods, 
were all the signs of Earth asking us is Evolution only meant for living 
things ? No, If earth has to do cope with human pace, she need changes but 
that changes are never a boon like evolution of other things. If the attack is 
to destroy from root, she has to fight back but can we really bear it?</p>

<p>Aren’t we passionate about our lives after 10000 years?
 But can we make it out in our present condition? Can we live with 
 bottled oxygen until then? Yes ,we can live in our beautiful earth for
  millions of years but only if we have a selfless mind. Let us look for w
  ys to fulfil our needs without harming her. We can reduce the use 
  of unavoidable ones to increase their availability. Abandon plastic, it should
   not be our taste. Let us switch from eco to ego .Let us cherish our mother
    earth with our selfless and thoughtful deeds . And all this is gonna
     happen because we are humans -the most powerful and 
     smartest beings in Earth.</p>
     
     
     <h1  id="Blog2">1. FROM A DISHWASHER AND WASHINGMACHINE TO A LIVING THING.</h1>

<p>Equality, the prohibition to discrimination according to the constitution and the 
    prominent word in popular speeches and articles but fated to be just a word ,
    never an action, relevent   to be printed in our hearts and spoken in our 
    actions but is still irrelevant after 2000 years of human existence. 
    The number of women who have never heard a 'NO' in her lifetime can 
    be counted with fingers because, there will be somebody to tell her 
    'No you can't do it ' in every spheres of life since she is a woman.
     And there is no country in this world where all the woman has the equal 
     rights as men;nor do I expect it to happen in the foreseeing future. 
     Girls has to face fears  unknown to a boy from her birth until death 
      only because of their gender. There were and are those who broke all
       bounds of ' what a girl should and should not do' and became bright 
       stars but their painstaking efforts would be ten times more than that
        a man should undergo.</p>

<h3>Beware of those tongues</h3>
<p>'How will the society respond'- but why should society care?
    This is our life and no one has to authorize our decisions. 
    Society is just a part of our life and not our reason to live.
    The society who says 'the girl is not disciplined' when she 
    raises her voice  a little higher,the society who comments 'The girl is spoiled' 
    if she is late from her work ,has the power to annoy our ears and not as strong to 
     harm us .And they will cheer for the same girl when she achieves her dreams because
      they are structured to follow the flow .Why care for a society that never give
       us grains to feed us for free?</p>

<h3>Don't act like a boy-why, I'm a girl</h3>

<p>'Wash your plates '; 'why isn't father doing it?':the answer comes 
    right away like missiles :'You are a girl'.But why?He has his own 
    hands too! And this protest is against a poor woman who was cleaning 
    the plates of all members in the family from the day her forehead was 
    dyed red. She started dying herself with ashes from then on . Realising 
    this,I went to her lecturing about her rights and asked her to stop being 
    a dishwasher ,nurse and a chef at the same time. But ,again she is a woman 
    and all of these are her responsibilities according to her. And ofcourse,men
     has to go  to work and earn for the family , children have to study. So she
      quit her job and became a never paid housemaid.
    "To the women he said ,' great will be your pain in child birth in sorrow 
    will your children come to birth ; still your desires will be for your husband 
    ,he will be your master'.And to Adam he said ,'the earth is cursed on your account ;
    in pain you will get your food from it all your life' "
So ,woman started to bear all pains ;give birth to children ;look after them and man 
started working to obtain food for his family. Years passed and when 
the responsibilities of men were taken over by women,yet she is inferior
 and incapable because she  is cursed to exist like that.</p>
<h3>The dumbed ones</h3>
<p>When boys are let to build up their career even after 30 years ,girls 
    are given the choice of marriage when they turn 18. And when a girl 
    still focus on her career after her 25 years ,sudden curses fall from 
    neighbours and realtives:'She is dumbed or disabled' .Is it that a girl
     can only dream of becoming somebody's dishwasher or washing machine. 
     Why should she be just a stepping stone of somebody to success and end
      up to be just a piece of stone?</p>

<h3>The incapable working society</h3>

<p>'Girls can study and work hard but their intelligence quotient 
    is not competent with that of boys,so better make her a worker 
    not the head'.And you worship  goddess Saraswathy as goddess of knowledge.
    The mental calculator popularly known as "human computer" ,Shakuntala Devi
     is a woman and girls have low IQ!' Go become a doctor or a nurse, engineering 
     or mechanics is meant for boys ';But there is no protocol  that  a doctor should 
      be a girl and engineer must be a boy.</p>
 
<p>Until the day ,it is scientifically proven that women are inferior
     to men,all are equal. It is often said that the only kind of beings
      is 'MALE' and 'FEMALE' but the only kinds  in reality are 'LIVING THINGS' 
      and 'NON LIVING THINGS' .In the next century or maybe ten centuries later,
      when all woman in the world are given equal rights and opportunities,when 
      egos and complexes are perished,when crime rate against women is reduced to
       zero, humans become truly civilized.Don't wait for that to happen,  be brave
        for yourself and not  perfect for your family or society.</p>
